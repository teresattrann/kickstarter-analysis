# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### 1. Purpose

The purpose of this challenge was to see if we are able to extract our given data and narrow it down to specific categories and subcategories efficiently and understand our data. To organize our data better and understand why we're doing it. By extracting only the Theater outcomes, we were able to narrow down to a specific category instead of looking through thousands of data and being overwhelmed. 

## 2. Analysis and Challenges 

I was able to perform my analysis quite well as the instructions were clear and easy to understand. I was able to further understand functions and how to use them to be more efficient in reading the data. Understanding and using the pivot table was very helpful as i was about to filter out what i needed exactly and continue to move the filters around to get the data i wanted. Using the COUNTIFS and SUM fuctions were extremely helpful as well on calculating the Successful vs the Failed projects, as well as the percentages. 

A challenge that i encountered was using the filter on the pivot table. I did follow directions on what to filter and what not to filter, but where to put each on which category was the main issue for me. I was able to overcome this challenge but experimenting with moving the categories around and seeing how it changes the pivot table.f

## 3. Results

According to the data, i can conclude that there were more successful Theater Outcomes than failed and canceled outcomes. The most successful launch dates for Theater was also in May and June. I can also conclude that the least successful month was in December. There was about the same amount of failed and there were successful outcomes in December. 

Given our data, i can conclude that both the highest number of successful and number of failed projects was when our goal was between $1000 and $4999. Therefore, our percentage successful was at 76% with only a 27% fail rate. As we reached a higher goal amount, it seems as though both the successful and failed projects decreased dramatically. For example, the percentage of successful vs. failed projects for $50000 or more was 13% and 88% ,respectively. 

Some limitations of the dataset was the number of campaigns that were in certain categories. For example, there seemed to be a lot of film/video and theater campaigns vs food, games and journalism campaigns. Film/video and theater did have the most successful campaigns but that is also because food, games, and journalism had less than half the amount of campaigns than film/video and theater campaigns had.

I believe if we create a pie or bar graph showing the campaign categories and subcategories we would be able to see the amount of campaigns we have in each category as there seems to be a lot more categories in film/ video vs the other categories.
